## Overview

British Airways (BA) is the flag carrier airline of the United Kingdom, serving customers worldwide. In today's highly competitive airline industry, customer acquisition and satisfaction are paramount. This project focuses on leveraging data and predictive modeling to proactively acquire customers before they embark on their holidays. We aim to predict customers' likelihood of buying holidays and provide insights for effective marketing and customer acquisition strategies.

## Data Preparation and Predictive Modeling

### Task 1: Customer Feedback Analysis

In Task 1, we collect and analyze customer feedback to gain insights into their feelings and needs. We employ web scraping and sentiment analysis techniques to understand customer sentiment and identify common themes in their feedback. Our goal is to provide actionable recommendations to enhance the customer experience.

### Task 2: Predictive Model Development

Task 2 involves building a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of customers purchasing holidays. This model utilizes high-quality customer booking data and predictive algorithms. We evaluate the model's performance and interpret the results to understand the predictive power of various variables.
